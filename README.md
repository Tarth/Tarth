Hello my name is Mikkel, and I'm currently learning how to build a SPA with a frontend in React Typescript, A REST backend with node.js and a PostgresSQL database, called Wiplanner. First version of the software (not feature complete) is running in production. I don't have a publicly available demo yet, but if you want a demo of the software in action you can contact me at zirax83@gmail.com, so I can setup a screensharing session (Zoom, Discord etc).

The rest of the projects in my profile are various unfinished learning projects. Wiplanner is my first actively maintained full stack application.

Regards Mikkel
